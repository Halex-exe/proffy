## Knowledges

This project helped me to develop a pratical knowledge in real WEB development strategies, such as front-end and back-end. I learned layout techniques like CSS using a mobile first approach, therefore having a responsive Website in a variety of devices (desk and mobo). It was used the Express for the back-end operation in the project, also I learned how to use templating engine called Nonjucks to render HTML using a JavaScript, and to store the teachers information was used SQLite.
